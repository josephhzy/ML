# ML
Building Machine Learn algorithms from scratch, to facilitate my understanding of each model. In Python.
Models I plan to cover will be

Linear Regression 
Logistic Regression 
K-Nearest Neighbors
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Decision Trees
Naive Bayes
K-Means
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Network
